            Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American
            communities of New Orleans, Louisiana, United States, in the late
            19th and early 20th centuries, with its roots in
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues">blues</a> and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragtime">ragtime</a>. Since
            the 1920s Jazz Age, it has been recognized as a major form of
            musical expression in traditional and popular music, linked by the
            common bonds of African-American and European-American musical
            parentage. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, complex
            chords, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation.
            Jazz has roots in European harmony and African rhythmic rituals.
